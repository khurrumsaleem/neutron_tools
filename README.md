# Neutron Tools

All to be considered work in progress

1. MCNP related - The MCNP team has now released their MCNP tools  https://github.com/lanl/mcnptools which is far more comprehensive than this project, but it still has a few useful parts to it..
 - lost_points :-	simple script to read MCNP output file and create a list of x,y,z co-ordinates where particles were lost 
		which can be plotted in visit

 - mcnp_run_plot :- read the dump to std out from MCNP6 and plots graphs of nps vs time, coll, nrn, ctm
 - ofile_reduce :-  reduces mcnp output file to just the last rendevous data, can be useful if the file size exceeds that of most text editors

 - mcnp_input_reader :- work in progress, soem basic ability to read and extract data from MCNP input file
 - mcnp_output_reader :- work in progress, can read some f2, f4 and f5 tally results
 - mcnp_analysis :- work in progress tools to analyse and plot MCNP output when read by mcnp_output_reader
 - meshtal_analysis :- reads MCNP meshtal file, can plot a slice, do some statistics, plot histogram of the rel err, count zeros etc
 - ptrac_reader :- reads MCNP ptrac files
 - magic:- mesh based magic variance reduction method

2. Fispact related
It should be noted that these are now mostly for historic useage as UKAEA have released an python fispact API which is superior for most cases.
 - fispact_input_reader :- currently just template stuff - do not use
 - fispact_output_reader :- currently just template stuff - do not use
 - fispact_analysis :-  a few plotting routines for fispact data
 - fispact_fluxes_writer:- useful functions for generating fluxes files

3. General
 - neut_utilities :- simple functions used by multiple modules
 - neut_constants :- set of useful constants and unit conversions
 - geom_utils :- set of geometry functions, distance between planes, area, volumes, intersections etc
 - r2s :- cell based two step activation tool, currently set for using mcnp and fispact
